# CS465-Fullstack
CS 465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

# Architecture
- Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
- Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

MongoDB database was utitlized for this project because of its ablity to scale horizontally and because it allows for easy updates to schemas.

# Functionality
- How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

In this project JSON is used to store and display data. JSON is a text-based way of representing JavaScript object literals, arrays, and scalar data. Javascript on the other hand is a scripting lanuage that allows for the creation of dynamic web page content. JSON allows for Javascript objects to be sent to and stored on the backend. Once the data is stored the front end can request that the data be pulled and used from the backend.

- Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

One instance in the full stack development process where I had to refractor code to improve functionality was changing the code from a simple webpage to a Single page application. Some benefits of reusable user interface components are a decrease in errors, provided the components are throughly tested and perfected, saves time and resources during development and reduces the overall size of the applicaion.

# Testing
- Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security.  
- Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application. 

# Reflection
- How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
